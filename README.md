# Exploring tRPC

[tRPC docs](https://trpc.io/docs/)

[express server](https://github.com/trpc/trpc/blob/main/examples/express-server/src/server.ts)

# Idea is to put router in the package

- Actual router will be imported and used by the express app

- But typescript type of the router will be used by the client apps(other express app, react application )
